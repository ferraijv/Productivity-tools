# Productivity-tools

This script is designed to act as a task manager program. It works with plain text files created in the appropriate format to seek through the most 
recent file, find the open tasks and move these to the new day's todo list. For tasks that were completed, it logs these into a file called completed_tasks
along with the day that they were completed.
